                    This Privacy Policy sets out the commitment of DataXing Digital India Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, "DataXing") to the privacy of its panel members ("Panellists", "Panellist") and governs Panellists' rights regarding privacy and data protection.<br><br>

                    This Privacy Policy applies to the DataXing Digital panel known as UKPolls, altogether identified in this Privacy Policy as the DataXing Digital Panels (the "Panels"). For clarity, this policy is publicly available on the UKPolls panel site as "UKPolls Panel Privacy Policy".<br><br>

                    Panellists are members of the Panels, operated by DataXing Digital, for which DataXing Digital acts as the data controller for the purposes of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.<br><br>

                    Participation in our panels, surveys, and research activities is entirely voluntary. By registering to the Panels and accepting these terms, you confirm that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Policy. We ask you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.<br><br>

                    For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual, as defined under the UK GDPR.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">2. Lawful Collection and Use of Data</span><br>

                    We collect your personal data in several ways, including through our website(s) (for example, your panel portal), mobile applications, and other activities such as social media, online studies, face-to-face interviews, telephone studies, and other research activities. We may introduce additional methods of data collection in the future; however, all processing will remain compliant with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

                    We are required by law to explain the legal basis for processing your personal data. Depending on the specific processing activity, the lawful bases include:<br><br>
                </p>

                <ul class="mx-3">
                    <li>where you have given consent;</li>
                    <li>where processing is necessary to perform a contract with you;</li>
                    <li>where processing is required to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
                    <li>where processing is necessary to protect vital interests;</li>
                    <li>where processing is necessary to perform a task carried out in the public interest; or</li>
                    <li>where processing is necessary for our or our clients' legitimate interests, provided those interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
