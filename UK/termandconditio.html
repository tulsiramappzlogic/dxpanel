                    These Terms of Use (this "Agreement") describe the terms and conditions applicable to your use of
                    DataXing Digital Services. You should read it, understand it, and review it periodically for
                    updates. If you have any questions that our <a href="https://panel.indiapolls.com/#/faq">Frequently
                        Asked Questions</a> cannot answer, please contact
                    <a href="https://panel.indiapolls.com/#/support">Support Team</a>. If you do not agree to this
                    Agreement, do not use our web site or services. We reserve
                    the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time, at our sole
                    discretion. Your continued use of our site will always indicate your acceptance of this Agreement
                    and any changes to it.<br>
                    <span class="bold">1. User Agreement Acceptance</span><br>

                    This Agreement applies to your access to, and use of, DataXing's web sites (the "Site") and the
                    services provided by DataXing, including DataXing's IndiaPolls and survey services. The Site, the
                    service, and any other services DataXing provides are referred to in this Agreement collectively as
                    the "Services"<br>

                    <span class="bold">2. Services<br></span>

                    The Services allow persons who meet eligibility requirements to take surveys or register for our
                    user panel (the "Panel"). Panel members may be eligible to participate in surveys on the Site. Panel
                    members may receive Points or other incentives for participation in services that DataXing may make
                    available from time to time.<br>

                    <span class="bold">3. Redemption Points; Active Status<br></span>

                    Once you have joined the Panel, IndiaPolls will offer incentives in the form of points (“Points”) or
                    other IndiaPolls types of incentives will be awarded when you undertake various Activities on the
                    Site, in line with the <a href="https://panel.indiapolls.com/#/rewards-program-terms">IndiaPolls
                        Rewards Program Terms</a>. Points are credited to your Account only
                    through your participation in Activities authorized by DataXing and are available for you to redeem
                    as long as your Account is Active.<br>

                    When you register to the Panel, your Account will have the status “Active”, you can participate in
                    all Activities you are invited to by DataXing and you can enjoy all Panel benefits such as access
                    our Services, your incentives, and contacting DataXing Personnel. To keep your account “Active”
                    means that you have joined the Panel and participated in a Survey or other activity on the Site
                    within 30 days from your initial registration or within any 90 day period.<br>

                    DataXing will not provide you with any notice of the cancellation and forfeiture of any of your
                    Points. DataXing reserves the right to amend these cancellation and forfeiture rules in its sole
                    discretion.<br>
                </p>

                <span class="bold">4. Suspension of Account; Cancellation Account<br></span>

                <p>Your Account can also be suspended if one of the following situations arises:<br></p>

                <ul class="mx-3">
                    <li>No participation after you have joined the Panel</li>
                    <li>No participation in a Survey within your first 30 days in the Panel</li>
                    <li>No participation in a Survey within any 90-day period</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If your Account has been suspended or closed, you have the right to ask DataXing to investigate the
                    situation. You should contact our Support team for that. If you feel your account has been
                    incorrectly suspended or closed, you must contact DataXing by email within sixty (60) days following
                    the alleged error and explain in full the basis of your dispute, attaching any relevant information
                    which offers evidence of the discrepancy. Upon receipt of your notice, we will investigate your
                    claim and notify you of our decision within thirty (30) days. If we need additional time to decide
                    your claim, we will notify you and will endeavour to render a decision as soon as reasonably
                    practicable. Any decision by us with regard to such a claim will be final.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    You may cancel your account at any time by going to our Site in your account section and click on
                    “cancel my account” and your account will immediately be cancelled. If you have any issues
                    cancelling your account please contact the support team. The support team will respond to you as
                    soon as reasonably practicable. Immediately upon deletion or your withdrawal from the Panel, your
                    account will be closed. You understand and agree that, as noted above, upon suspension, cancellation
                    or closing of your account, your right to access the Services will cease and all Points credited to
                    your account at such time, however and whenever accumulated, will be forfeited. DataXing may
                    terminate your account at any time for any reason.
